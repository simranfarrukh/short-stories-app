      It was during my weekly visits to the Lakeview Assisted Living Home in 2015 when I picked up the habit of stitching up holes in my T-shirts. {'\n'}{'\n'}

One of the gentlemen I visited, Mr. Danish Rahmani, a D-Day veteran, living out his final days at a senior home in Phoenix, Arizona with no family to fall back on, had taught me how to sew. He was always very particular about proper posture, proper eating habits and behaviour. Proper attire—I imagine having spent their entire lives in the military does that to people, so I never begrudged his grumbling about my clothes, my humped back, or my unkempt hair, or the stubble I would always carry due to lack of self-preservation.{'\n'}{'\n'}

“Clothes make the man,” he used to say, every time I stepped into the shared living room at the senior home wearing my torn band T-shirts. A distinct look of displeasure colouring his war-stricken features.{'\n'}{'\n'}

“Good morning to you too, Mr. Rahmani,” I would say, grinning cheekily at the old man. “What do you feel about checkers today? Or are we in the mood for another haiku reading?”{'\n'}{'\n'}

He would always grumble his replies to me after that, but he was never one to let displeasure fester between us and was in possession of an unnaturally cool temperament. We always ended up laughing by the time my volunteering shift was over. Now that I think about it, I cannot recall what we laughed about. Times spent with him were oddly reminiscent of those spent with high school friends. I can never remember the details, but I remember the feelings.{'\n'}{'\n'}

Living in the gentle suburbs of Phoenix meant my clothing options were usually limited to cotton jerseys and torn skinny jeans that I usually bought from the Goodwill Store near my college dormitory. One day, however, demanded the use of a particularly old, cotton jacket—one that was till date, locked in the suitcase I had left home with three years ago. Usually, I would ignore the need of it because the weather was never cold enough to warrant one, but I like to think it was fate that I put it on that day. (I am a romantic one, you could say.){'\n'}{'\n'}

“There you go again with those torn clothes!” he said the first thing as I stepped onto the backyard—they had moved the meeting area to the backyard because the weather was kind enough that day. “Young man, back in my days, young men your age would never step foot out their homes dressed like that.”{'\n'}{'\n'}

I shook my head at the familiar exasperation in his words and pulled up a chair in front of his tiny table, taking of my jacket as I sat. “I bet young men my age back then could probably afford decent clothes and weren’t burdened with sales tax, and dorm rent, and inflation in the economy with the same old minimum wage that is fifty years overdue in increasing.”{'\n'}{'\n'}

“Excuses, excuses!” he exclaimed, folding his arms against his chest.{'\n'}{'\n'}

“So! What are you in the mood for today?” I asked him, trying to diffuse his frustration with my clothing habits. And as was expected, he easily acquiesced, with a nod towards the deck of cards waiting on the table.{'\n'}{'\n'}

We played go fish, and blackjack, and as evening touched the horizon, we had moved in to listen to some old Indian songs Mr. Rahmani was especially fond of. The songs were nice enough, but I was more of a hard rock kind of a guy back then.{'\n'}{'\n'}

I left my jacket at the senior home that day.{'\n'}{'\n'}

And as is the practice of creative writers, this is where I tell you about my acquired habit of stitching up my clothes.{'\n'}{'\n'}

When I came back the next week, Mr. Rahmani was carrying the widest grin I had seen on him. He was also holding on to my cotton jacket. It was ironed and folded in a classic Navy fold.{'\n'}{'\n'}

“Did I leave that behind the last time I came?” I asked him, and he smiled pushing the jacket in my hand. His gestures screamed unfold and see it, already! So, I did.{'\n'}{'\n'}

The holes in the top collar, side front, and the sleeve head had been stitched. Tiny little flowers, no bigger than an infant’s big toe, replaced the open gaps that had once marred the beautiful jacket.{'\n'}{'\n'}

I remember crying as I put it on. It was the first gift I had received from anyone in a long, long time. More so from an adult.{'\n'}{'\n'}

After that, I think it had become sort of a habit. I would bring my torn T-shirts, jeans, even shoes to my visits, and together Mr. Rahmani and I would stitch them up. He taught me how to stitch the little flowers, and animals, and words—those were the first things I learned to stitch, in fact. He also taught me different kinds of stitches—his favourite was the overlock stitch that his ex-wife had taught him. He had cried as he taught me. Now, it is my favourite as well.{'\n'}{'\n'}

I like to think he left pieces of himself in ever clothing item I own today. Even the ones he never touched.{'\n'}{'\n'}

It has been six years since. Mr. Rahmani passed away two years ago on this very day. I am not sure how long I will hold these memorials for him, but I like to think it will be a while before I stop.{'\n'}{'\n'}

Mr. Rahmani did not teach me anything monumental about life. He did not give me some advice I would take to the grave. And maybe his impact on my life was not as strong as I feel it to be. In fact, I think my dentist has impacted my life more than Mr. Rahmani with his constant reminders to floss! But I am attached to him. To his memory.{'\n'}{'\n'}

I still have unkempt hair, and bad posture. I still wake up too late and his military discipline never rubbed off on me. My clothes are mostly stitched up though.{'\n'}{'\n'}

I have not stopped stitching up holes with pieces of myself in them—just like Mr. Rahmani stitched himself into my battered soul with those tiny, little blue perennials on my old cotton jacket six years ago.{'\n'}{'\n'}
