Once upon a time, in a small town whose name I can never remember, a baby boy was born in the middle of an eclipse. {"\n"}{"\n"}

With a pale, sickly complexion and pulsating boils all over his body, the boy cried all day long. {"\n"}{"\n"}

His skin, frail and almost dead, would peel away, painfully at a mere touch. {"\n"}{"\n"}

Angrily. {"\n"}{"\n"}

Mercilessly. {"\n"}{"\n"}

With that fragile body, like a butterfly’s wings, always hurting— always in pain, all he did was trigger disgust in anyone who saw him.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Even his mother…{"\n"}{"\n"}

Scared by his ghastly appearance, the mother locked him away in a tiny bedroom of their tiny, little house.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Vowing to never lay eyes on him again.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Still, she was his mother after all, and her heart wouldn’t allow her to just let the poor, unfortunate child die. {"\n"}{"\n"}

So she tasked her eldest son, his brother, with a chore.{"\n"}{"\n"}

“Take care of him, my son. For he is your brother,” She had said.{"\n"}{"\n"}

“Feed him the food I make for you. And talk to him when he finds the silence frightening. {"\n"}{"\n"}

Comfort him when he’s in pain, my son. {"\n"}{"\n"}

For he is your brother…” {"\n"}{"\n"}

Alas! Fate was not so lenient, towards the poor, little butterfly boy.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Sickened by the way his brother looked, the elder brother left no stone unturned in torturing the poor soul. {"\n"}{"\n"}

“You monster!” He would yell at the butterfly boy. {"\n"}{"\n"}

And throw food at him out of apparent spite. {"\n"}{"\n"}

He would gather the town's children, and mock the little boy to his face.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Yelling at him.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Beating him. {"\n"}{"\n"}

Starving him.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Hurting him all the more.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And every day the deformed boy would watch from a small peephole in his prison room. {"\n"}{"\n"}

He watched his mother kiss, hug, love the elder brother.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Watched her caress his face with affection every time the evil brother did something nice for her.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And watched her pat his back when she was proud.{"\n"}{"\n"}

He watched her watch the elder brother sleep with a smile on her face. {"\n"}{"\n"}

The mother, none the wiser, lived content with the knowledge that despite her revulsion for her youngest, her eldest was there for him.{"\n"}{"\n"}

As she grew older, the mother’s eyesight depleted and her face was adorned by glasses so huge they covered half her visage.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Sometimes the butterfly boy wondered how nice it would be if those glasses just broke.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Would she finally love me too?{"\n"}{"\n"}

Years dragged away in the same fashion, with the elder brother tormenting the  one. {"\n"}{"\n"}

With the younger brother hurting still.{"\n"}{"\n"}

One day, however…{"\n"}{"\n"}

On a day when the sun decided to hide away from the little boy, much like the day he was born, something in him snapped.{"\n"}{"\n"}

His anger, his hatred for his brother, tipped over his vessel of patience.{"\n"}{"\n"}

So he waited that night for his brother to bring him food, just like he always did every day.{"\n"}{"\n"}

His brother waltzed into the room, with a small serving of meat and another slew of insults ready to hurl, when the little boy jumped at him.{"\n"}{"\n"}

He scratched.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And bit.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And punched.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And cut the elder brother.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Finally releasing all his pent up anger, he killed the evil brother.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And carved out his skin, that he was so very proud of, to wear as his own.{"\n"}{"\n"}

With his brother’s blood on his hands, and his skin on his back, he ventured out of his prison for the first time ever.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Timid steps wandering purposefully around the small house in search of his mother.{"\n"}{"\n"}

He found her sleeping in her chair and hesitated before stepping closer.{"\n"}{"\n"}

She woke up at the sound of his quiet footsteps though, and called for the brother he had killed and was wearing.{"\n"}{"\n"}

Her hands, searching for her glasses, never reached them— he slid the glasses away so she wouldn’t see.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And he stood in front of the woman who had birthed him all those long years ago and all she did was squint.{"\n"}{"\n"}

“Did you hurt yourself, my son?” She asked, alarm evident in the sharpness of her voice.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And for the first time ever, she reached out to touch him. {"\n"}{"\n"}

Caressing and blowing at his brother’s blood on his face that she mistook for a wound.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And for the first time ever, the peeling of his skin didn’t hurt.{"\n"}{"\n"}

For the first time ever, the pain was bearable.{"\n"}{"\n"}

And in a broken voice he spoke, for the first time ever, “how come your touch… doesn’t hurt? M… Mother…”{"\n"}{"\n"}

She jerked her hand back at his voice, as if burned by his words. {"\n"}{"\n"}

As if she had realised it was him instead of the elder son.{"\n"}{"\n"}

“My boy…” she said. Acknowledging his existence for the first time since he’d been locked away.{"\n"}{"\n"}

She hesitated. Her fingers halted before she forced them to reach back towards the boy.{"\n"}{"\n"}

But he was gone.{"\n"}{"\n"}

He ran away, with his brother’s blood staining his hands and his skin molting on his back.{"\n"}{"\n"}

He ran away, with the memory of the loving touch of his mother etched into his mind.{"\n"}{"\n"}

What did the boy really want?{"\n"}{"\n"}

Revenge on his brother for all those years of torment?{"\n"}{"\n"}

Or affection from his mother that he never gained?{"\n"}{"\n"}
