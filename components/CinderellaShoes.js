      The Prince searches for days on end for Cinderella, clutching onto her red ballet shoe as if holding life itself in his hands. He searches the hills and the lakes and the small villages hidden in the valleys but finds her he does not.{'\n'}{'\n'}

As days pass, he starts to lose hope. Alas! Is the girl lost forever!? He wondered. However, as fate would have it, on the tenth day of his search for the mysterious ballerina, by some stroke of luck, he finds her. Sitting in a cosy little corner of the woods, she lived with her stepmother and sisters in a wooden hut.{'\n'}{'\n'}

He barges into the little hut and demands the stepmother and sisters to present their left feet to try the shoe on. The ladies comply willingly, neither of them is Cinderella though. But the Prince is no fool. He sees the women share fervent glances with each other and shoot uneasy glances at the basement door.{'\n'}{'\n'}

He charges his soldiers towards the basement, yelling at his guards to hold the stepmother and sisters down. And there, in the corner of the dingy basement, hiding under the fireplace sits Cinderella with her arms around her body defensively. {'\n'}{'\n'}

The shoe fits her wonderfully.{'\n'}{'\n'}

So, he commands his soldiers to have her taken away from the wretched family of hers. Out from the dingy, mouldy basement and into the royal palanquin. The stepmother and sisters yell, bite, and beg the Prince to not take her away. They are beheaded on the spot for keeping her incognito for so long.{'\n'}{'\n'}

As the Prince’s entourage returns to the palace, there are greeted with fanfare, felicities, fireworks, and music. The kingdom is rejoicing like it's the eve of Christmas as they welcome the new Princess. The Princes escorts his to-be Princess to her bedroom and kisses her hand before excusing himself.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
The festivities in the Kingdom continue all night as Cinderella sits in her royal tower, crying as she mourns the death of her stepmother and sisters. The sky from her bedroom shimmers with kaleidoscopic hues of fireworks rejoicing another year of prosperous crop and wealth for the kingdom. The doors and windows in her room are locked but she has given up on trying to run away.{'\n'}{'\n'}

In the morning, she will be married to the Prince in a royal, ritual wedding. And at night he will put on the red ballet shoes on her feet so she can dance for the Fairy Godmother until her feet bleed or she dies (whichever shall come first); thereby fulfilling her destiny as the 99th Bride of Prince Charming.{'\n'}{'\n'}
